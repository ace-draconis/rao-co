<h3>Edit this Page</h3>
<p>To edit this page, simply navigate to the folder you installed <strong>Grav</strong> into, and then browse to the <code>user/pages/01.home</code> folder and open the <code>default.md</code> file in your <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/requirements">editor of choice</a>.  You will see the content of this page in <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown">Markdown format</a>.</p>
<h3>Create a New Page</h3>
<p>Creating a new page is a simple affair in <strong>Grav</strong>.  Simply follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to your pages folder: <code>user/pages/</code> and create a new folder.  In this example, we will use <a href="http://learn.getgrav.org/content/content-pages">explicit default ordering</a> and call the folder <code>02.mypage</code>.</li>
<li>
<p>Launch your text editor and paste in the following sample code:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: My New Page
---
# My New Page!

This is the body of **my new page** and I can easily use _Markdown_ syntax here.</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Save this file in the <code>user/pages/02.mypage/</code> folder as <code>default.md</code>. This will tell <strong>Grav</strong> to render the page using the <strong>default</strong> template.</li>
<li>That is it! Reload your browser to see your new page in the menu.</li>
</ol>
<div class="notices yellow">
<p>NOTE: The page will automatically show up in the Menu after the "Home" menu item. If you wish to change the name that shows up in the Menu, simple add: <code>menu: My Page</code> between the dashes in the page content. This is called the YAML front matter, and it is where you configure page-specific options.</p>
